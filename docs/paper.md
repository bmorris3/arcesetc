# Summary

The ARC Echelle Spectroscopic (ARCES) Exposure Time Calculator, or ``arcesetc``,
is a simple exposure time calculator for the ARCES instrument on the 
Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) 3.5 m Telescope at Apache Point 
Observatory for stellar spectroscopy. Users can supply ``arcesetc`` functions 
with the spectral type of their target star, the V band magnitude, and either: 
the desired exposure time in order to determine the counts and signal-to-noise
ratio as a function of wavelength; or the desired signal-to-noise ratio at a 
given wavelength to determine the required exposure time. 

We estimate the count rates for stars as a function of wavelength by fitting 
15th-order polynomials to each spectral order of real observations of a star of 
each spectral type. These polynomial coefficients and some wavelength metadata
are stored in an HDF5 archive for compactness and easy of reconstruction. Then
upon calling ``arcesetc``, the archive is opened and the spectral order closest
to the wavelength of interest is reconstructed from the polynomial 
coefficients, for a star of the closest available spectral type to the one 
requested. 

At present, the 79 stellar spectral types included in the ``arcesetc`` library
span from mid F to mid M stars on the main sequence, a variety of M giants, 
a handful of O and B, and and a white dwarf and a Wolf-Rayet star. Contributions
from the community are welcome to expand the library to include other spectral 
types.

``arcesetc`` was built from the Astropy package-template, and thus includes 
self-building documentation and continuous integration [@astropy:2018].
